# Image Captioning Bot

This project was inspired from Microsoft's captionbot.ai. I created a deeplearning model using Google Colaboratory resources and used the model in this web application(developed using Flask) to generate captions for the given image. This flask app takes Image or URL as input and generates relevant caption.

## Requirements
Flask 1.1.1
Keras 2.3.1
numpy 1.18.1
Pillow 7.0.0
requests 2.23.0
tensorflow 1.13.2
