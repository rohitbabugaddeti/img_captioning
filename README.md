# Image Captioning Bot

This project was inspired from Microsoft's captionbot.ai. I created a deeplearning model using Filckr8k dataset, Google Colaboratory resources, InceptionV3, LSTM, GloVe and used the model in this web application(developed using Flask) to generate captions for the given image. This flask app takes an Image or URL as input and generates relevant caption.

Flask 1.1.1\
Keras 2.3.1\
numpy 1.18.1\
